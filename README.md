# ðŸŽ¨ ArtPortfolio Move Module

## Description
The **ArtPortfolio** contract is a custom Move module built for the Aptos blockchain.  
It allows users (such as students or artists) to mint their digital artwork as NFTs and manage ownership transfers.  
Each NFT contains provenance information including:
- Title of the artwork  
- Creatorâ€™s address  
- Current ownerâ€™s address  
- Timestamp of creation  
- Metadata URI pointing to associated resources (e.g., images, files, or descriptions)  

The contract also manages collections for each account, storing all NFTs owned by that address.

## Vision
The vision of **ArtPortfolio** is to create a decentralized gallery where creators can:
- Preserve their artistic work on-chain.  
- Maintain full transparency and verifiable ownership history.  
- Empower students and independent artists to showcase and transfer their artwork without intermediaries.  

## Future Scope
This project can be extended with the following enhancements:
- **Royalty Mechanism**: Reward original creators whenever their artwork is resold.  
- **Marketplace Integration**: Enable listing, auctions, and peer-to-peer NFT sales.  
- **Advanced Metadata**: Support for more formats such as audio, video, and 3D assets.  
- **Verification & Certification**: Allow trusted institutions or galleries to validate artwork authenticity.  
- **Community Curation**: Group collections and collaborations for student communities and art clubs.  

## Contract Address
Once deployed to the Aptos blockchain, the module will be accessible at:
